                        FOUND ITS VOICE IN MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.

                        <p>WITHIN A MONTH, I HAD BUILT OVER FOUR PROJECTS WHILE LEARNING JAVASCRIPT ALONGSIDE, BUT I REALIZED THEY WERE FAIRLY COMMON AND LACKED UNIQUENESS.
THAT’S WHEN I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON QUALITY OVER QUANTITY AND PLANNED TWO MEANINGFUL PROJECTS, THIS PORTFOLIO BEING ONE OF THEM, WITH THE OTHER STILL IN PROGRESS.</p>

                        <h3>2024 - Learning Full Stack Development</h3>
                        <p>The learning began not with a single language, but with an entire ecosystem. 2024 was the year I mapped the full terrain, moving from the user-facing front-end I knew into the vast, logic-driven wilderness of the back-end. It was a year of connecting the dots, of understanding how a click in a browser triggers a cascade of events across servers and databases.

I built my first full-stack application from the ground up. This meant architecting a database with SQL, crafting APIs with Node.js and Express to serve data, and finally, connecting it all to a React front-end. The thrill was in the integration—seeing a form submission on my webpage successfully write a new record to a table I designed. I learned about authentication, securing routes with JWT tokens, and managing state not just in the browser, but across the entire request-response cycle.

The paradigm shift was profound. Development became a holistic practice in systems thinking. I debugged not just broken layouts, but failed API calls and inefficient database queries. Tools like Docker and Git became essential, as I learned to containerize my environments and manage increasingly complex codebases.

This journey transformed me from a builder of interfaces to an architect of experiences. I now think in data flow, in endpoints, and in the seamless handshake between client and server. 2024 was the year the pieces locked into place, granting me the profound capability to envision and execute a complete, functioning digital world, one full-stack project at a time.</p>
